# 2D Shadow Casting

An implementation of two dimensional shadow casting.
The shadows change by moving the mouse around the window.

There is also a black dot drawn randomly which moves everytime
the user's mouse lands on it. It has been drawn as black so that
it only seems to appear when the light falls on it.
